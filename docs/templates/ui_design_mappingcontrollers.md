# Keyboard

+ Having used **WASD** as the character movement controls, it is recommended that **W** and **S** be used to navigate the menus as well, with **W** being to move the menu selection **up** and **S** to move the menu selection **down**.
+ While **E**, **Enter** and **Space**, used to interact with the environment, can be used to **select** a menu and thus enter the next submenu or give it to accept. These can vary making only 1 of these keys work to do the named action.
+ Finally, **Escape**, will be used as **cancel** or **go back**, while when the player is in the main menu of the submenus, it will close completely and return to the game.

# Gamepad

+ Having used the **left stick** and the **d-pad** as the movement controls of the characters, it is recommended that these are also used to navigate through the menus, with the **up d-pad button** and **up left stick** above to move the menu selection **up** and **down d-pad button** and **down left stick** to move menu selection **down**.
+ While **A**, used to interact with the environment, can be used to **select** a menu and thus enter the next submenu or give it to **accept**.
+ **B**, will be used as **cancel** or **backward**, while when the player is in the main menu of the submenus, it will close completely and return to the game.
+ Finally, the **Menu button** on the Xbox One controller can be used to close the menu completely regardless of which submenu it is in and thus **return** to the game immediately.
