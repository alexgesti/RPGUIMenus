# What is a UI?

UI can be defined as that which is interposed between the player and the game itself allowing a relationship between both, or in other words, the interface is the part of the game that is always present in video games in one way or another helping the player providing information at all times.
A good use of it implies the difference between feeling that you move a character or that you press a key, that is why it must be robust and powerful but as subtle as possible in a way that facilitates the immersion of the player in the game.

 + **Interface objective**: to give the player the ability to control the gaming experience at all times, therefore it has to be easy to learn and use.
 + **Generally, it must**: guide the player towards the objectives, be intuitive, beautiful, fluid, predictable, influential...
 
# UI types and how they are executed in the market

+ **Diegetic**: the elements of this type of interface exist within the game world so that the player and the character can interact with them through visual, audible or tactile means.
Well-executed elements of this type of interface enhance the narrative experience for the player, providing a more immersive and integrated experience.

  + *Splatoon 2: Octo Expansion -> Main menu*
    + The main menu allows level selection, viewing conversation as if it were a chat, viewing collectibles or the same options all happens within the same game, making the character truly observe everything at the same size as the player appreciates it. 
    + In addition, a small extra detail that this menu has is that the player when moving the joystick to change the level or option, makes the character also move the joystick that he has in his hand, making this menu immerse the player more when he controls it.

  + *Persona 5 Strikers -> Third Eye*
    + The game uses its third eye to highlight enemies and their level, see nearby treasures and see the places which the player can stand to wait to attack.
    
      This makes the player and the character see the same thing, since the accompanying characters when observing the actions that they can do will warn the player about it.

+ **Goal**: Sometimes ui elements don't belong in the physical world of the game, but they can still maintain the narrative of the game.
  
  + *Overwatch -> Blood*
    + In this case, when the player takes enough damage to have 25% of their life left, the screen will fill with blood, implying that the player is losing life.

  + *Xenoblade Chronicles 2 -> Special Attack*
    + In certain moments of the combat, the game will show a sequence of buttons while the characters make a special move which will do more damage than a normal one.
    + At this moment the game warns when and which buttons the player must press so that the character can execute the movement correctly, if the player fails at any time, this movement will be choppy and the characters will not finish executing the movement.

+ **Spatial**: used when it is necessary to break the narrative to provide the player with more information than the character should know. It still belongs to the physical world of the game to help immerse the player and avoid having to break the experience by jumping to the menu screens. The more they follow the fictional rules of the game, the more they can help to immerse the player.

  + *Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell -> Mechanics in the atrezzo*
    + The game teaches the player the simple mechanics to survive, for example, moving and covering, but putting the texts of the tutorial in the props of the level.

  + *World of Warcraft -> Players name*
    + This shows the player the names of each player around him so that he does not have to click on them and know who each person is.
      
    ![Wow - Blizzard](https://github.com/alexgesti/RPGUIMenus/blob/main/docs/images/wownames.png)

+ **Non-diegetic**: These elements are free to be completely removed from the narrative and physical world of the game and can adopt their own visual treatment, albeit often influenced by the art direction of the game.
  These types of UI are usually typical of RPGs.

  + *Final Fantasy VII -> Combat HUD*
    + The game shows the information necessary to play in this mode, that is, what character you can use, what movement you are going to make, the life they have, etc., and although it has an artistic style similar to that of the game, it is not part of the game. world of the game nor of the narrative of this.

# Types of RPGs and what are different from them

Although RPGs are a very specific genre in the world of video games, there are different variants of these, each with its peculiarities and differences, of which we will name some of these:

+ **Turn-based combat**: The style most used by the main JRPGs on the market, such as Pokémon, the classics Final Fantasy, Dragon Quest, Shin Megami Tensei, Persona ... It is a system in which the player moves his character as a representative of the group in a mapping and he enters with his companions in a combat screen where the actions are decided in a menu and the speed of each participant is what decides their turn of action.

  These games, in general, when you travel the world, there is usually little or no data in the interface, so that players can appreciate the props of the world and contemplate it.
  
  ![Pokemón Let's Go, Eevee! - Nintendo](https://github.com/alexgesti/RPGUIMenus/blob/main/docs/images/pokemoneeveeforest.png)
  
  On the other hand, when the general menus are opened they are usually very simple, although showing a lot of visual content, so that the player will have the image of what that menu action does in his head.
  
  ![Pokemón Let's Go, Eevee! - Nintendo](https://github.com/alexgesti/RPGUIMenus/blob/main/docs/images/pokemoneeveemenu.png)
  
  While when in combat, the data of life and stamina of each player's usually shows some subtle way with the image of the character or name in a particular order: most important character to minor character, starting always with the protagonist and ending with the last member of the group.
  
  In addition, it usually shows the life of a bar of a green or bluish color, implying that the player can be calm since they have a lot or enough life. In case of having little, these usually turn a reddish tone and usually warn with some type of sound.
  
  ![Pokemón Let's Go, Eevee! - Nintendo](https://github.com/alexgesti/RPGUIMenus/blob/main/docs/images/pokemoneeveecombat.png)
  
+ **ARPG - Action RPG**: These are titles in which we usually manage a character that we can move freely to fight against the enemies that appear on the stage. Some of these examples would be Kingdom Hearts, The Elder Scrolls, The Witcher, etc.

  In this case, being a game that does not have any transition to combat, it usually works with a very standard UI model so that it works both when you are fighting and when you are not, showing life, the map, the equipment that is carried and, in some cases, the combat tray.
  
  ![Kingdom Hearts 3 - Square Enix](https://github.com/alexgesti/RPGUIMenus/blob/main/docs/images/kh3toystory.png)
  
  It should be noted that in some cases, when the player enters combat, some element of the interface usually changes some element of the interface, be it that the bar appears constantly, that the character changes pose, that the action bar changes to reddish hue, etc.

+ **SRPG - Strategic RPGs**: In general, this subgenre is usually the one that bears the most similarities to board RPGs, dividing the scenarios into squares, allowing us to handle large groups and giving each unit a certain mobility that can be affected by terrain accidents.

This type of RPGs, represented mainly by series such as Shining Force, Fire Emblem, Final Fantasy Tactics or Disgaea.

Regarding the composition of the interfaces of these in combat, it usually shows the board in a kind of grid and allows the player to know which squares both the player and the opponent can move during their turn.

On the other hand, this interface usually also shows the names of the characters, the life of which it has, both visually and in an extended way once it is about to attack.

In addition it also shows in a simple way the percentages of success, damage and critical, as well as the same data of the rival.

On the other hand, these menus usually let the player change weapons quickly by pressing a button on the gamepad.
